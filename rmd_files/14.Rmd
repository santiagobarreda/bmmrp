# Conclusion

This book is over, now what? We leave you with a very brief discussion on some of the topics we didn't get to or chose to not discuss. 

## Filling in the blanks

- good practice, other stuff, data processing, linear transformations
- a million other things
- research design, sample size, etc
- colinearity


## Non-linear models

- explain linear model, linear combination
- non linear models: everything else


## Other error distributions

- kind of trivially simple compared to learning this book. read chapter on logistic regression, learning poisson is gonna be pretty simple
- mention some more well known ones


## Multivariate analyses

- multiple dependent variables
- very simple with brms
- kind of almost just like two separate analyses except correlations bertween residuals (when these can be estimated) and random effects


## Causal modeling

- establishing causality is hard
- more important for observational stuff
